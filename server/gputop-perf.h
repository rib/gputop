/*
 * This structure tracks the offsets to the perf record headers in our
 * perf circular buffer so that we can enable perf's flight recorder
 * mode whereby perf may overwrite old samples and records with new
 * ones but in doing so it trashes the perf headers that we need to
 * determine the location of sequential records.
 *
 * The alternative to this would be to copy all data out of the perf
 * circular buffer into another buffer, so it can't be overwritten by
 * perf but that would demand further memory bandwidth that we want to
 * avoid wasting.
 *
 * With this approach we don't *actually* enable perf's flight
 * recorder mode, because as we update our record of header offsets we
 * can update the perf tail to say that these records have been read
 * so we can have our flight recorder mode without perf knowing. The
 * advantage of this is that if for some corner case userspace gets
 * blocked from updating its record of header offsets for a long time
 * and the kernel comes to wrap around then we will get notified of
 * that condition by the kernel. In that case we end up loosing recent
 * samples instead of old ones, but something has to have gone quite
 * badly wrong in that case anyway so it's hopefully better to report
 * errors reliably instead.
 *
 * To simplify this, there is a limit on the number of headers we
 * track, based on the expected number of samples that could fit
 * in a full perf circular buffer.
 *
 * The header offsets are stored in a circular buffer of packed uint32
 * values.
 *
 * Due to the fixed size of this buffer, but the possibility of many
 * small perf records, (much smaller than our expected samples),
 * there's a small chance that we fill this buffer and still loose
 * track of some older headers. We can report this case as an error
 * though, and this is a more graceful failure than having to scrap
 * the entire perf buffer.
 *
 *
 * For each update of this buffer we:
 *
 * 1) Check what new records have been added:
 *
 *    * if buf->last_perf_head uninitialized, set it to the perf tail
 *    * foreach new record from buf->last_perf_head to the current perf head:
 *        - check there's room for a new header offset, but if not:
 *            - report an error
 *            - move the tail forward (loosing a record)
 *        - add a header offset to buf->offsets[buf->head]
 *        - buf->head = (buf->head + 1) % buf->len;
 *        - recognise when the perf head wraps and mark the buffer 'full'
 *
 * 2) Optionally parse any of the new records (i.e. before we update
 *    tail)
 *
 *    Typically we aren't processing the records while tracing, but
 *    beware that if anything does need passing on the fly then it
 *    needs to be done before we update the tail pointer below.
 *
 * 3) If buf 'full'; check how much of perf's tail has been eaten:
 *
 *    * move buf->tail forward to the next offset that is ahead of
 *      perf's (head + header->size)
 *        XXX: we can assert() that we don't overtake buf->head. That
 *        shouldn't be possible if we aren't enabling perf's
 *        overwriting/flight recorder mode.
 *	  XXX: Note: we do this after checking for new records so we
 *	  don't have to worry about the corner case of eating more
 *	  than we previously knew about.
 *
 * 4) Set perf's tail to perf's head (i.e. consume everything so that
 *    perf won't block when wrapping around and overwriting old
 *    samples.)
 *
 * XXX: Note: if tracing and using this structure to track headers
 * then when you want to process all the collected data, it's
 * necessary to stop/disable the event before consuming data from the
 * perf circular buffer due to how we manage the tail pointer (there's
 * nothing stopping perf from overwriting all the current data)
