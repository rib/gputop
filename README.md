# gputop

GPU Top is a tool to help developers understand GPU performance counters and provide graphical and machine readable data for the performance analysis of drivers and applications. GPU Top is compatible with all GPU programming apis such as OpenGL, OpenCL or Vulkan since it primarily deals with capturing periodic sampled metrics.

GPU Top so far includes a web based interactive UI as well as a non-interactive CSV logging tool suited to being integrated into continuous regression testing systems. Both of these tools can capture metrics from a remote system so as to try an minimize their impact on the system being profiled.

GPUs supported so far include: Haswell, Broadwell, Cherryview, Skylake, Broxton, Apollo Lake, Kabylake, Cannonlake and Coffeelake.

It's not necessary to build the web UI from source to use it since the latest tested version is automatically deployed to http://gputop.github.io

If you want to try out GPU Top on real hardware please follow these [build Instructions](https://github.com/rib/gputop/wiki/Build-Instructions) and give feedback [here](https://github.com/rib/gputop/issues).

# CSV output example

Here's an example from running `gputop-csv` like:

```gputop-csv -m RenderBasic -c Timestamp,GpuBusy,EarlyDepthTestFails,RasterizedPixels```

Firstly the tool prints out a header that you might want to share with others to help ensure your comparing apples to apples when looking at metrics from different systems:

```
CSV: Capture Settings:
CSV:   Server: localhost:7890
CSV:   File: STDOUT
CSV:   Metric Set: Render Metrics Basic Gen9
CSV:   Columns: Timestamp,GpuBusy,EarlyDepthTestFails,RasterizedPixels
CSV:   OA Hardware Sampling Exponent: 18
CSV:   OA Hardware Period: 21845333.333333332ns
CSV:   Accumulation period (requested): 1000000000ns

CSV: Capture Notices:

```

And then compactly prints the data collected. In this case the output was to a terminal and so the data is presented to be easily human readable. When output to a file then it will be a plain CSV file and numbers aren't rounded.
